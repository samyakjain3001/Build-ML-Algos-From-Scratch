# Build-ML-Algos-From-Scratch
This repo contains implementation of basic ML algorithms in **Python3**, using **Numpy**.

#### Algorithms 
- Logistic Regression
- Perceptron
- Softmax Regression
- K Nearest Neighbour (Classification)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- K Nearest Neighbour (Regression)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- K-Means Clustering

In order to understand the workings of the different machine learning algorithms, I started implementing them using just Numpy and Python without the aid of any external libraries. (During the course CS771-Inroduction to ML)
